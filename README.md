# Learning Solidity 
Dedicating the first quater of 2021 to deep diving into blockchain, crypto, and learning Solidity. I will undertake a few projects from differing sites and books. 

## Why in One Repo?
A valid question, with mutiple differing projects it does not follow the best practice. However, this repo is a collection of all the projects and notes which have helped me learn more about Solidity and blockchain.

## Current Projects

- **Book**: [Hands-On Smart Contract Development with Solidity and Ethereum](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-smart-contract/9781492045250/)
	- [Greeter](https://github.com/BrunoDavies/Learning-Solidity/tree/master/greeter): A basic "Hello World!" smart contract wirtten in Solidity and tested using JavaScript. Following the example in Ch.4
