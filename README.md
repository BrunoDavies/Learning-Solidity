# Learning Solidity 
Dedicating the first quater of 2021 to deep diving into blockchain, crypto, and learning Solidity. I will undertake a few projects from differing sites and books. 

## Why in One Repo?
A valid question, with mutiple differing projects it does not follow the best practice. However, this repo is a collection of all the projects and notes which have helped me learn more about Solidity and blockchain.

## Current Projects

* Book: Hands-On Smart Contract Development with Solidity and Ethereum:
	* Greeter.
